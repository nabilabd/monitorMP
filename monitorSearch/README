# Installation

Once in the directory containing monitorSearch/monitorSearch/, run the following command:

```
make
```
This generates an executable `analyzer`.

Alternatively, to both generate the executable as well as timing results, one can use the bash script 
```
sh commands.sh
```

Running this command generates a file `results.txt`, containing execution times for running each of four algorithms
on one hundred pairs of nodes, and parallelized over three different thread counts.


# USAGE

The executable takes four arguments, and is run as follows:

```
./analyzer FILE_NAME SOURCE_ID DEST_ID NUM_THREADS
```

* FILE_NAME is the name of the file containing the text representation of a graph
* SOURCE_ID is the ID number of the vertex which is to be the source node in the algorithms
* DEST_ID is the ID number of the vertex which is to be the destination node in the algorithms
* NUM_THREADS is the number of threads which the OMP algorithms are parallelized over
